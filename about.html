        <p>"Here, at Delicious Bites, we understand cravings. We know how important it is to get your food fast, and we have a 1-hour delivery guarantee, or you get your money back.
            While we prepare our food fast, we develop the flavor slowly. Our dough rises over the night, and our meat is always marinated. That's why every chicken tender, every beef skewer, and every bun tastes like heaven.</p>

        <p>Delicious Bites was born from a passion for cooking and a desire to create a place where people could experience the joy and comfort of good food. Founded by Piera Kanake in 2023, our cozy eatery in Nairobi quickly became a beloved dining destination known for its unique blend of flavors, impeccable service, and inviting ambiance. Each dish on our menu reflects Emily's culinary journey, combining traditional recipes with modern twists and locally sourced ingredients. Today, Delicious Bites continues to uphold its commitment to excellence, innovation, and community, inviting diners to experience the magic of our kitchen and create unforgettable memories with us</p>
